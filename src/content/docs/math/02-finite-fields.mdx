We already know that all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ under standard addition and multiplication form a field. However, when working with cryptography, we don't use real numbers due to many reasons like rounding errors (for other reasons, you could ask AI). Instead, we use integers modulo a prime number, which form a finite field. Most modern cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs, rely on the finite fields.

## Finite Fields

A finite field (also known as a Galois field) is a field that contains a finite number of elements. It's denoted as $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. The order (number of elements) of the field is $p^n$.

<Aside type="note">
    So the order of a finite field is always a power of a prime number. It cannot be any arbitrary positive integer. For example, there is no finite field with 6 elements because 6 is not a power of a prime number.

When $n=1$, we also denote the field as $\mathbb{F}_p$, and it has $p$ elements. We'll only work with this case first. Later when talking about "elliptic curve pairings", we'll revisit the case where $n > 1$.

For example, $\mathbb{F}_7$ is the finite field with 7 elements: $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

Recall that $(\mathbb{R},+,\cdot)$ is a field. It has two operations: addition and multiplication. Since every element in it has an additive inverse (e.g., -3.1415 is the additive inverse of 3.1415), and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (e.g., $\frac{1}{3}$ is the multiplicative inverse of 3), we can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) in this field.

Similarly, in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, we can also perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero). However, all operations are performed modulo $p$. The addition and multiplication rules are straightforward:

$$
\begin{align*}
a + b \equiv (a + b) \mod p \\
a \cdot b \equiv (a \cdot b) \mod p
\end{align*}
$$

<Aside type="note">
    We use the symbol $\equiv$. This is the convention when working with modular arithmetic. It means "is congruent to".
</Aside>

For example, in $\mathbb{F}_7$:

$$
\begin{align*}
3 + 5 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \\
4 \cdot 6 \equiv 3 \mod 7
\end{align*}
$$

Remember subtraction is essentially adding the additive inverse. The additive inverse of an element $a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ is very intuitive: it's just $p - a$. For example, in $\mathbb{F}_7$, the additive inverse of 2 is $7 - 2 = 5$. We can verify that $2 + 5 \equiv 0 \mod 7$. Since the additive inverse of 2 is 5, when we subtract 2 from an element, we are essentially adding 5 to it. This is really intuitive (imagine a clock with 7 hours).

Division is a little bit tricky. To divide by an element $a$ (where $a \neq 0$), we need to multiply by its multiplicative inverse. The multiplicative inverse of an element $a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ is an element $b$ such that $a \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod p$. We also denote the multiplicative inverse of $a$ as $a^{-1}$. For example, in $\mathbb{F}_7$, the multiplicative inverse of 2 is 4 because $2 \cdot 4 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7$. So when dividing an element by 2, we are essentially multiplying it by 4.

$$
\begin{align*}
6 / 2 \equiv 6 \cdot 4 \equiv 24 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \\
5 / 2 \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 6 \mod 7
\end{align*}
$$

Note "normally" 5 is an odd number and it cannot be divided by 2. However, in the finite field, we can always find the multiplicative inverse of any non-zero element (by the definition of a field), so division is always possible. **Always remember division is essentially multiplying by the multiplicative inverse, and subtraction is essentially adding the additive inverse.**

<Aside type="note">
    We intentionally omit the algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse here. You can look it up if you're interested. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Fermat's Little Theorem are 2 common methods to find the multiplicative inverse in finite fields. Time complexity for both methods is $O(\log p)$, so it's still very efficient even for large primes.

## Intuitive Arithmetics of Finite Fields

Here is a table comparing arithmetics in real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and finite fields $\mathbb{F}_7$:

| $\mathbb{R}$ | $\mathbb{F}_7$ |
|:-|:-|
| $1 + 2 = 3$ | $1 + 2 \equiv 3 \mod 7$ |
| $3 + 5 = 8$ | $3 + 5 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7$ |
| $2 - 3 = -1$ | $2 - 3 \equiv -1 \equiv 6 \mod 7$ |
| $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ | $2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \mod 7$ |
| $2 \cdot 4 = 8$ | $2 \cdot 4 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7$ |
| $1 / 2 = \frac{1}{2}$ | $1 / 2 \equiv 1 \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \mod 7$ |
| $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$ | $a \cdot (b + c) \equiv a \cdot b + a \cdot c \mod 7$ |
| $1 / 2 + 1 / 3 = \frac{5}{6}$ | $1 / 2 + 1 / 3 \equiv 1 \cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \cdot 3^{-1} \equiv 2 \equiv 5 / 6 \mod 7$ |
| $a \cdot b \neq 0 \iff$ both $a$ and $b$ are non-zero | $a \cdot b \neq 0 \iff$ both $a$ and $b$ are non-zero |
| If $a^2 = b$, then $(-a)^2 = b$ | If $a^2 \equiv b \mod 7$, then $(-a)^2 \equiv b \mod 7$ |
| ... | ... |

## Isomorphism Again

When we are talking about finite fields (with prime order), we always use the set of integers modulo a prime number $p$, i.e., $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}$. This is because any finite field (with prime order) is isomorphic to this set with addition and multiplication defined modulo $p$.
